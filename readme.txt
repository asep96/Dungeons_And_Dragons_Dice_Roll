Dungeons and Dragons Dice Roller 1.2.

This application was built so that users playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends over a 
digital platforms could play without using dice. This bare bones version features 
some hover animations and will return a random number when a standard die is rolled or with a  
custom die, where the user can roll a dice that has X number of sides on it. Logic is 
built in so that the user is alerted if their custom roll is not a number and needs to 
be re-entered again.

1.1: Changed some colors so that they are lighter. Removed the instructions under the title and
added a help button that displays instructions when clicked by the user. Also added logic
that will have the result change color if the user has two of the same results in a row.

1.2: Added multi-roll feature, where if the user needs to roll a 3d6 (three 6-sided dies)
they are now able to do so and have the total roll result presented to them.

This application was built with HTML5, CSS Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript.
