Dungeons and Dragons Dice Roller 1.0.

This application was built so that users playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends over a 
digital platforms could play without using dice. This bare bones version features 
some hover animations and will return a random number when a standard die is rolled or with a  
custom die, where the user can roll a dice that has X number of sides on it. Logic is 
built in so that the user is alerted if their custom roll is not a number and needs to 
be re-entered again.

This application was built with HTML5, CSS Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript.
